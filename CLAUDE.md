# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a Python CLI application for controlling Sonos speakers. Key components:

- **sonos/cli.py**: Main CLI interface using Click framework with command definitions
- **sonos/sonos_actions.py**: Core Sonos functionality using the SoCo library to interact with speakers
- **sonos/config.py**: Configuration file containing API keys and service endpoints  
- **sonos/sonos_config.py**: Sonos-specific configuration (station definitions, metadata templates)
- **sonos/get_lyrics.py**: Lyrics retrieval from Genius API using cloudscraper

## Architecture

The application follows a layered architecture:
1. CLI layer (cli.py) handles user input and command parsing
2. Action layer (sonos_actions.py) implements Sonos control logic
3. Configuration layer provides service endpoints and settings

The main entry point is the `sonos` command defined in pyproject.toml that maps to `sonos.cli:cli`.

## Key Dependencies

- **soco**: Python library for controlling Sonos speakers
- **click**: Command line interface framework
- **cloudscraper**: Web scraping with CloudFlare bypass
- **unidecode**: Unicode text handling

## Common Commands

Install dependencies:
```bash
uv sync
```

Install the CLI tool in development mode:
```bash
uv pip install -e .
```

Run the CLI:
```bash
sonos --help
```

The CLI supports master speaker selection with `-m/--master` and verbose output with `-v/--verbose`.

## Music Service Integration

The application integrates with Amazon Music as the primary music service (configured in config.py). It handles different URI formats for:
- Amazon Music catalog tracks
- Spotify tracks  
- Amazon Music library tracks
- Local playlists
- Radio stations (Pandora, WNYC, etc.)

## Key Functions

- **play_track()**: Search and play individual tracks
- **shuffle()**: Create shuffled playlists from artist searches
- **play_album()**: Play complete albums
- **play_station()**: Play predefined radio stations
- **current_track_info()**: Get information about currently playing track

## Claude Code Integration for Music Requests

Claude Code now has MULTIPLE approaches for handling music requests, from fully automated LLM-powered intelligence to manual control.

### Automatic Music Request Detection

**When Claude Code detects any of these natural language patterns, automatically use the optimal LLM-powered approach:**

#### Natural Language Patterns
- **Direct requests**: "play [song/artist]", "I'd like to hear...", "Can you play...", "Put on..."
- **Artist possessive forms**: "Neil Young's Harvest", "Ani DiFranco's fixing her hair", "The Beatles' Here Comes the Sun"  
- **Preference requests**: "live version of...", "acoustic version of...", "studio version of..."
- **Casual requests**: "some [artist]", "something by [artist]", "[song] by [artist]"

#### Auto-Detection Examples
‚úÖ **These should automatically trigger the music agent:**
- "I'd like to hear a live version of Neil Young's Harvest"
- "Play some Beatles"  
- "Put on Ani DiFranco's fixing her hair"
- "Can you play Harvest by Neil Young?"
- "I want to hear something by Pink Floyd"
- "Play a live version of Comfortably Numb"

### Primary Method: Hybrid LLM-Powered Agent (Optimal)

**For any detected music request, use the fully LLM-powered approach:**

```python
from claude_music_interface import play_music_parsed_with_llm, parse_music_request_llm

# OPTIMAL: Full LLM workflow with standardized prompts (parsing + result selection)
def handle_music_request(user_request):
    # Step 1: LLM-powered parsing with standardized prompt
    parsed = parse_music_request_llm(user_request, task_function=Task)
    
    # Step 2: LLM-powered result selection with standardized prompt
    result = play_music_parsed_with_llm(
        parsed['title'], 
        parsed['artist'], 
        parsed['preferences'],
        task_function=Task  # Enable hybrid LLM selection
    )
    return result
```

**Alternative approach with manual Task calls:**
```python
# Step 1: Manual LLM-powered parsing (uses standardized prompt internally)
from music_parsing_prompts import STANDARD_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT

parsed = Task(
    description="Parse music request",
    prompt=STANDARD_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT.format(request=user_request),
    subagent_type="general-purpose"
)

# Step 2: Continue with hybrid agent...
```

#### Hybrid Agent Capabilities
- **Natural Language Understanding**: Perfect parsing of possessives, complex grammar, preferences
- **Intelligent Result Selection**: Uses music knowledge to choose optimal versions
- **Smart Complexity Detection**: Only uses LLM when algorithmic approach insufficient
- **Music Industry Knowledge**: Understands albums, collaborations, version types, authenticity
- **Contextual Decision Making**: Prefers originals over compilations, authentic over covers
- **Smart Search Strategy**: Multiple query variations with fallback strategies  
- **API Error Recovery**: Automatically handles known Amazon Music API parsing issues

#### Hybrid Agent Examples
```python
# Complex cases use LLM intelligence:
handle_music_request("I'd like to hear a live version of Neil Young's Harvest")
# ‚Üí LLM parses request AND chooses best live version from search results

handle_music_request("Ani DiFranco's fixing her hair")  
# ‚Üí Perfect possessive parsing, intelligent result selection

handle_music_request("Like a Hurricane by Neil Young")
# ‚Üí LLM chooses original studio album over compilations/covers

# Simple cases use fast algorithmic selection:
handle_music_request("Bohemian Rhapsody by Queen")  
# ‚Üí Fast selection without LLM overhead for obvious matches
```

### Alternative Method: Standard LLM Parsing (Good)

For simpler integration without hybrid result selection:

```python
from claude_music_interface import play_music_parsed

# Step 1: LLM-powered parsing (same as above)
parsed = Task(description="Parse music request", prompt="...", subagent_type="general-purpose")

# Step 2: Standard result selection (algorithmic only)
result = play_music_parsed(parsed['title'], parsed['artist'], parsed['preferences'])
```

### Fallback Method: Manual CLI Workflow (Advanced Users)

When you need manual control or the agent approach fails, use the traditional two-step process:

#### 1. Search for Tracks
```bash
sonos searchtrack harvest by neil young
```

Returns numbered results:
```
1. Harvest Moon-Neil Young-Harvest Moon
2. Harvest (2009 Remaster)-Neil Young-Harvest (2009 Remaster)  
3. Heart of Gold-Neil Young-Harvest
4. Harvest-Neil Young-Harvest
5. Harvest (Live)-Neil Young & Stray Gators-Tuscaloosa (Live)
```

#### 2. Select and Play
```bash
sonos playtrackfromlist 4
```

#### When to Use Manual CLI
- **Advanced Control**: When you want to see all search results before selecting
- **Agent Fails**: If the intelligent agent can't find what you want
- **Debugging**: When you need to understand why a search behaved a certain way
- **Scripting**: When building automated workflows

### Additional Sonos Commands

**Playback Control:**
- `sonos what` - Current track info
- `sonos pause` / `sonos resume` - Pause/resume playback  
- `sonos louder` / `sonos quieter` - Volume control
- `sonos showqueue` - View playback queue

**Alternative Interface Functions:**
```python  
from claude_music_interface import pause_music, resume_music, get_current_track

pause_music()     # Pause playback
resume_music()    # Resume playback  
get_current_track()  # Get current track info
```

## Decision Tree for Claude Code

**Use this decision tree to determine how to handle user requests:**

```
User Request ‚Üí Contains music patterns? 
                ‚Üì
              YES ‚Üí Use Hybrid LLM Agent:
                    1. Parse with Task subagent
                    2. Call play_music_parsed_with_llm() with Task function
                ‚Üì
              NO ‚Üí Regular sonos CLI command or other action
```

### Optimization Guidelines

**For BEST results, always use the hybrid approach:**
1. **LLM Parsing**: Use Task subagent to parse natural language
2. **LLM Result Selection**: Pass Task function to enable intelligent selection  
3. **Automatic Complexity Detection**: System decides when to use LLM vs algorithmic selection
4. **Graceful Fallback**: Falls back to programmatic selection if LLM unavailable

### Music Request Detection Patterns

**Automatically trigger the music agent when user input contains:**

#### High-Confidence Patterns (Definite music requests)
- **Command verbs**: "play", "put on", "start", "queue up"
- **Request phrases**: "I'd like to hear", "Can you play", "I want to listen to" 
- **Possessive forms**: "[Artist]'s [Song]" (e.g., "Neil Young's Harvest")
- **By constructions**: "[Song] by [Artist]" (e.g., "Harvest by Neil Young")

#### Medium-Confidence Patterns (Likely music requests)  
- **Preference requests**: "live version of", "acoustic version", "studio version"
- **Casual requests**: "some [artist]", "something by [artist]"
- **Artist mentions**: Names of known musicians in context

#### Pattern Examples with Expected Actions
```
‚úÖ "I'd like to hear a live version of Neil Young's Harvest" 
   ‚Üí Full LLM workflow: parse + hybrid selection

‚úÖ "Play some Beatles" 
   ‚Üí Full LLM workflow: parse + hybrid selection

‚úÖ "Put on Ani DiFranco's fixing her hair"
   ‚Üí Full LLM workflow: parse + hybrid selection  

‚úÖ "Can you play Harvest by Neil Young?"
   ‚Üí Full LLM workflow: parse + hybrid selection

‚úÖ "Like a Hurricane by Neil Young"
   ‚Üí Full LLM workflow: LLM chooses original album over covers/compilations

‚ùå "What's the current track?"
   ‚Üí get_current_track() or sonos what

‚ùå "Pause the music"  
   ‚Üí pause_music() or sonos pause

‚ùå "Make it louder"
   ‚Üí sonos louder
```

### Key Advantages of Hybrid Approach

**üéØ Intelligent Result Selection Examples:**
- **"Like a Hurricane by Neil Young"**: Chooses original "American Stars 'N Bars" album over Greatest Hits compilation
- **"Harvest Moon live"**: Finds live recordings from concert albums like "Live at Massey Hall" 
- **"Unplugged version of..."**: Understands MTV Unplugged albums are acoustic performances
- **Multiple remasters**: Prefers original releases over anniversary/deluxe editions when no preference specified

## Legacy Helper Functions (Deprecated)

The `sonos_helpers.py` module is now deprecated in favor of the intelligent agent, but remains available for reference:

### Key Functions

- **parse_search_results(output)**: Parse sonos searchtrack output into structured data with album information
- **find_best_match(results, title, artist, preferences)**: Find the best matching track using smart algorithms with album-aware live detection
- **extract_music_request(input)**: Extract title, artist, and preferences from natural language requests
- **execute_smart_search(title, artist, preferences)**: Multi-search strategy with intelligent query variations
- **handle_music_request(input)**: Complete end-to-end workflow for processing music requests
- **clean_title(title)**: Remove remasters, live tags, and other annotations
- **similarity_score(str1, str2)**: Calculate string similarity for fuzzy matching

### Usage Examples

#### Basic Music Request
```python
from sonos_helpers import handle_music_request

# Simple one-step workflow
position = handle_music_request("play harvest by neil young")
# Returns: position to play (e.g., 4)

if position:
    subprocess.run(['sonos', 'playtrackfromlist', str(position)])
```

#### Advanced Workflow with Live Version Preference
```python
from sonos_helpers import extract_music_request, execute_smart_search

# Extract request with preferences
title, artist, preferences = extract_music_request("play a live version of harvest by neil young")
# Returns: ("harvest", "neil young", {"prefer_live": True})

# Execute smart search with multiple query attempts
position = execute_smart_search(title, artist, preferences)
# Tries: "live harvest neil young", "harvest live neil young", etc.
# Returns: position of best live version match
```

#### Manual Step-by-Step
```python
from sonos_helpers import parse_search_results, find_best_match, extract_music_request

# Extract request components
title, artist, preferences = extract_music_request("play harvest by neil young")
# Returns: ("harvest", "neil young", {})

# After running sonos searchtrack
results = parse_search_results(search_output)
# Returns: [(1, "Harvest Moon", "Neil Young", "Harvest Moon"), (2, "Harvest", "Neil Young", "Harvest"), ...]

# Find best match with preferences (now album-aware)
position = find_best_match(results, title, artist, preferences)
# Returns: 2 (for exact "Harvest" match from studio album)
```

### Integration Workflow for Claude Code

#### Option 1: Simple One-Step Workflow (Recommended)
```python
from sonos_helpers import handle_music_request
import subprocess

position = handle_music_request(user_request)
if position:
    subprocess.run(['sonos', 'playtrackfromlist', str(position)])
    # Confirm what's playing with: sonos what
```

#### Option 2: Advanced Multi-Search Workflow
1. **Parse User Request**: Use `extract_music_request()` to get title, artist, and preferences
2. **Execute Smart Search**: Use `execute_smart_search()` which tries multiple query variations
3. **Play Track**: Execute `sonos playtrackfromlist <position>`
4. **Confirm**: Show user what's playing

### Enhanced Features

#### Live Version Detection
The system now detects requests for live versions using patterns like:
- "play a live version of harvest by neil young"
- "live recording of harvest neil young" 
- "concert version of harvest"
- "harvest live neil young"

When live versions are requested, the system:
1. **Tries live-specific searches first**: "live harvest neil young", "harvest live neil young"
2. **Album-aware live detection**: Identifies live recordings from album names using patterns:
   - "live from", "live at", "concert", "acoustic", "unplugged", "artists den"
3. **Enhanced scoring**: Live tracks get +0.3 score bonus when requested
4. **Smart fallback**: Falls back to studio versions if no live matches found

#### Multi-Search Strategy
For complex requests, the system tries multiple search queries:
- Base query: "harvest by neil young"
- Live variants: "live harvest neil young", "harvest live neil young", "neil young harvest live"
- Selects best match across all search attempts

#### Album-Aware Live Detection Example

Request: "play a live version of burgundy shoes by patty griffin"

Search results:
```
1. Burgundy Shoes-Patty Griffin-Children Running Through
2. Burgundy Shoes-Patty Griffin-Patty Griffin: Live from the Artists Den
```

The system detects that "Live from the Artists Den" indicates a live album and selects position 2, even though the track title doesn't contain "live".

This approach handles variations like remasters, live versions, and fuzzy title matching while intelligently preferring the requested version type using both track titles and album context.

## Standardized Prompt System

### Overview
The music request parsing now uses **standardized prompt templates** instead of ad-hoc prompts written during conversations. This ensures consistent behavior and makes the parsing logic maintainable.

### Key Files
- **`music_parsing_prompts.py`**: Centralized prompt templates
- **`claude_music_interface.py`**: Enhanced with standardized prompt integration

### Standardized Parsing Function
```python
from claude_music_interface import parse_music_request_llm

# Use standardized parsing (requires Claude Code Task function)
parsed = parse_music_request_llm(
    "I'd like to hear a live version of Neil Young's Harvest",
    task_function=Task  # Claude Code provides this
)

# Returns consistent format:
# {
#   "title": "harvest",
#   "artist": "neil young", 
#   "preferences": {"prefer_live": true}
# }
```

### Prompt Templates Available

#### 1. Standard Music Parsing
- **Template**: `STANDARD_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT`
- **Purpose**: Parse title, artist, preferences from natural language
- **Output**: `{"title": str, "artist": str|null, "preferences": dict}`

#### 2. Enhanced Music Parsing (Ready for Extension)
- **Template**: `ENHANCED_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT` 
- **Purpose**: Same as standard + album information
- **Output**: `{"title": str, "artist": str|null, "album": str|null, "preferences": dict}`

#### 3. Result Selection
- **Function**: `format_result_selection_prompt()`
- **Purpose**: Generate standardized prompts for choosing best track from search results
- **Usage**: Automatically used by `ClaudeCodeMusicAgent`

### Benefits of Standardization

#### Before (Ad-hoc):
```python
# Inconsistent prompts written during conversations
Task(prompt="Parse 'Neil Young's Harvest' and extract...")  # Variable instructions
```

#### After (Standardized):
```python
# Consistent, maintainable templates
from music_parsing_prompts import STANDARD_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT
Task(prompt=STANDARD_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT.format(request="Neil Young's Harvest"))
```

### Advantages
- **üéØ Consistency**: Same parsing logic every time
- **üìã Maintainability**: Easy to modify parsing rules in one place
- **üîç Transparency**: You can see exactly what instructions the LLM gets
- **üß™ Testability**: Standardized prompts can be refined and tested
- **üìà Extensibility**: Ready foundation for adding album or other fields

### Integration with ClaudeCodeMusicAgent
The enhanced agent now uses standardized prompts for both parsing and result selection:
- **Parsing**: Uses `STANDARD_MUSIC_PARSING_PROMPT` template
- **Selection**: Uses `format_result_selection_prompt()` function
- **Fallback**: Gracefully falls back to base implementation if templates unavailable

## Known Issues

### Amazon Music API Search Parsing Error
Some specific search terms trigger a parsing error in the SoCo library:
- **Error**: `TypeError: string indices must be integers, not 'str'`
- **Cause**: Amazon Music API returns malformed responses for certain search combinations
- **Example**: `sonos searchtrack "fixing her hair"` fails, but `sonos searchtrack "fixing hair"` works
- **Workaround**: Try alternative search terms if a search fails unexpectedly
- **Status**: Documented in `SEARCH_API_ISSUE.md` for future SoCo library fix

This is a known issue with the underlying SoCo library's parsing of Amazon Music API responses, not with our enhanced search system.
